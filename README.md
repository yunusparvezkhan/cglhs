# cglhs - Chatra Ganeshlal High School
I am a student of Chatra Ganeshlal High School. Which is situated in Birbhum district of the Indian state of West Bengal. 
It is really quite a good school just for it's teachers. My school does not have aa decent infrustructure or support from the government. 
Although as a begginer Web Developer I thought  I should make a website for my school, which will be beinificial for the development of mhy school and also be an inspiration for the other schools as well

So basically my goal for now is to build a basic website with no special webapp features. It will have a good front end experience 
and some information about the school. Then after launching it from the school, me along with a small team will convert it to 
a web app by adding some extra features on the site, like online admission, inbuild social media for school students, discussion hub 
specially for teachers or committees and some more like these.
